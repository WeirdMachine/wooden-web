This is my github pages project.

I will try some web frontend stuff here.

The name wooden-web comes from the first idea i had: building a webgl application which shows a forest. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## TicTacToe

To learn reactjs I started with this tutorial: [reactjs.org/tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

That's why you can still find the TicTacToe game inside my page.

The Tutorial came with some differences because i use typescript integration and linting. 

I was able to learn even more than the tutorial, because i was challenged with types in react from beginning on which
 helped me to understand the framework.
 
## web-gl

I will start this when i finished TicTacToe and my base site
